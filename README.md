## üîñ Description

Collection of exercises made in [Patrones de dise√±o en JavaScript y NodeJS](https://www.udemy.com/course/patrones-de-diseno-en-javascript-y-nodejs/) course by Nicolas Schurmann and [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Nicolas Schurmann's course language is Spanish but exercises are written and commented in English for a global understanding.

First course exercises will be marked with an **A** and the second ones will be marked with a **B**.

Finally, and just to be clear, some content are not patterns actually but methodologies, techniques or good practices.
